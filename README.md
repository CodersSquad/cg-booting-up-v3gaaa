# Computer Graphics Booting Up

## Let's start with ModernGL

This lab stands to prepare the moderngl development environment. Below the steps and requirements for initial coding tasks. Please make sure to edit the python provided files; for dependencies, you can add the files you need.

1. Install moderngl and its dependencies
2. Make sure that the following programs run
    - [`01_hello_world.py`](./01_hello_world.py)
    - [`06_multiple_objects.py`](./06_multiple_objects.py)
    - [`09_models_and_images.py`](./09_models_and_images.py)
        - _Modify this program to change the box's texture to a correctly aligned TEC logo_
3. Document how to execute the 3 programs in the section below.

* For documentation and missing dependencies, follow these links:
    - https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl
    - https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/

## How to run your program

```
# Update this section with instructions on how to run your programs. 

# Consider that these instructions will be executed 
in a completely new linux-based machine (Ubuntu 22.04),
so, instructions for dependencies installation must be added.

# It's highly recommended to use python virtual envs. 
You may take a look on:
